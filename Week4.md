# Week 4

## Concepts and Activities
We are continuing our analysis of our initial trees.

## Tools

### Viewing BEAST outputs
BEAST generates a number of output files.
1. The first is the MCMC log ("<nameOfInput>.log")
2. The second output is the .trees file. ("<nameOfInput>.log")
3. If we run other analyses in BEAST, it may generate other types of outputs in the same directory.

### Viewing Trace with Tracer
1. Load .log file into Tracer by dragging or selecting.
2. Explore the convergence of the parameters.

- What is convergence?
- What is the ESS?
- What is the "Hairy Caterpillar"?


## Terms and Definitions

We also discussed the Coalescent. A framework for understanding the influence of past poulation size fluctuations on the tree shape and the interpretation of the tree parameters.

See [CoalTrace](https://bedford.io/projects/coaltrace/) examples.

# Next week:
Analyze outputs from our tree in python or R!
